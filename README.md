## What is NRC Sudoku?

NRC Sudoku is a challenging variant of the classic Sudoku puzzle, originally published by the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad. It features additional constraints that make it more complex and engaging than standard Sudoku.

### Rules of the Game

NRC Sudoku follows the basic Sudoku rules with an important twist:

1. **Standard Rules:**
   - Fill a 9√ó9 grid with digits from 1 to 9
   - Each row must contain all digits 1-9 without repetition
   - Each column must contain all digits 1-9 without repetition
   - Each of the nine 3√ó3 boxes must contain all digits 1-9 without repetition

2. **NRC Special Rules:**
   - In addition to the nine standard 3√ó3 boxes, there are **four extra 3√ó3 regions** (highlighted in gray)
   - These four additional regions are positioned at:
     - Top-left corner starting at position (2,2)
     - Top-right corner starting at position (6,2)
     - Bottom-left corner starting at position (2,6)
     - Bottom-right corner starting at position (6,6)
   - Each of these four gray regions must also contain all digits 1-9 without repetition

This means NRC Sudoku has **13 regions** in total (9 standard boxes + 4 NRC boxes) that must satisfy the uniqueness constraint, making it significantly more challenging than regular Sudoku!
